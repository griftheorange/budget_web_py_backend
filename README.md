Init Framework for budgeting application using pandas/flask backend and temporary React Frontend. Python classes and method should be formatted to favor refactoring into an electron app later on.

Note to self:
- run 'budget' to execute both commands below in one step
- run 'bback' to open and start flask server
- run 'bfront' to open and start react frontend development mode
